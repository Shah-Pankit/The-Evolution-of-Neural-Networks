# The Interactive Evolution of Neural Networks

This is a single-page interactive web application that serves as a visually engaging and educational tool for exploring the history of neural network models. The application transforms a dense, chronological report into an intuitive, exploratory experience, allowing users to understand the key architectures and their evolution over time.

## üöÄ Features

* *Interactive Timeline:* Navigate through key neural network models from the foundational concepts of the 1940s to modern generative and transformer models.
* *Dynamic Content:* Clicking on any model on the timeline or in the navigation dynamically updates the main content area with detailed information.
* *Model Details:* Each model features a summary of its core principles, a list of its key innovations, and a tabbed interface for exploring its advantages, limitations, and applications.
* *Conceptual Diagrams:* Simplified architectural diagrams for each model are built using HTML and CSS, providing a clear visual representation of their structure without relying on external images or complex libraries.
* *Interactive Chart:* A dynamic radar chart visually compares the selected model's "Impact," "Complexity," and "Efficiency" against related models in its category.
* *Responsive Design:* The application is built with Tailwind CSS to ensure a seamless and optimized experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* HTML: The core structure of the single-page application.
* CSS: Styled using the **Tailwind CSS** framework via a CDN for a modern and responsive design.
* JavaScript: Vanilla JavaScript handles all interactive logic, dynamic content updates, and state management.
* Chart.js: Used for generating the interactive radar chart to visualize model comparisons.

## üí° How to Use
